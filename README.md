# Oak Chain Docs (EDS Port)
This project is my learning path for Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS). It ports the VitePress-based `oak-chain-docs` site to EDS and includes experiments with new block types, including a novel **Narration** block.

## Environments
- Preview: https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/
- Live: https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.live/

## Documentation

### EDS learning references
Before using the aem-boilerplate, we recommend you go through the documentation on https://www.aem.live/docs/ and more specifically:
1. [Developer Tutorial](https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial)
2. [The Anatomy of a Project](https://www.aem.live/developer/anatomy-of-a-project)
3. [Web Performance](https://www.aem.live/developer/keeping-it-100)
4. [Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking](https://www.aem.live/developer/markup-sections-blocks)

### Project notes
- Narration block ideation: `oak-chain-docs-eds/narration-block-ideation-journey.md`

## Blocks

### Narration
The narration block renders an audio player with an AI-voice disclosure and optional transcript link. Audio is expected to be pre-generated and served from a CDN/edge URL.

Authoring pattern (EDS table):
```markdown
| narration |
| --- |
| Title | Thesis Narration |
| Description | AI narration of the Oak Chain thesis. |
| Audio | https://cdn.example.com/oak/thesis.mp3 |
| Transcript | /thesis |
| Note | Audio generated by AI. |
```

Supported keys (first column):
- `Title`, `Heading`, `Name`
- `Description`, `Summary`, `Text`, `Body`
- `Audio`, `Audio URL`, `Audio Src`, `Src`, `URL`
- `Transcript`, `Transcript URL`, `Transcript Link`, `Transcript Path`
- `Note`, `Disclaimer`
